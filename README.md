# To-Do List Application

This project is a fully functional To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It is designed to work seamlessly on all devices.

## New Project Details

- **Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA)**: The project is initialized using CSA for a streamlined development setup.

## Usage

- **npm start**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
  
- **npm run build**: Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder, ready for deployment.

## Note

For optimal production performance, consider adding a build bundler plugin like `@snowpack/plugin-webpack` or `snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle` to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

No eject is needed, as Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.

Happy coding!
